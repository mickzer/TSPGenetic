# TSPGenetic

This is an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem for the CS211 module at Maynooth University in 2014.

The program expects an text input file with a list of towns along with their geographical coordinates. Distances between the towns are calculated using the Haversine function.

After some time, this implementation found a solution within 10% of the optimum for 80 towns.
